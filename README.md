# HabitTracker

HabitTracker is a web application designed to help users create, update, delete, and track their habits on a daily basis. It is a user-specific app, allowing individuals to monitor their habits and mark them as done or not done. The project is built using a tech stack that includes Node.js for server-side scripting, Express for handling HTTP requests and routing, MongoDB for data storage and management, and EJS for rendering views and templates.
